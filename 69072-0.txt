PREFACE


How to teach a child to read so as to create and preserve the right
attitude toward reading is one of the most important problems of the
school. That it has not been solved to the joint satisfaction of theorist
and of practical teacher is evidenced by the continued discussion of the
subject both in speech and in print.

This little primer may not prove to be the last word on primary reading.
It is in my opinion the most valuable word that has yet been spoken.
For here we have several of the most important desiderata for whose
combination all are searching.

The matter is interesting to the persons to whom it is addressed; it is
a series of stories about several little children told in conversational
form. Its thought units are short but sequential, and its vocabulary is
small, each word being presented with interest, and repeated with variety
in its relations. As a natural outgrowth of the acquaintance with old
words comes the power to decipher new words. The phonic lessons are well
graded, and the subject is properly subordinated to thought getting.
The appeal made to the primitive, æsthetic enjoyment of the jingle, with
simple melody and captivating rhythm, as the phonics are presented, is
followed by the gratification of finding them contributory to the ability
to read the classic rimes which follow.

That all these values characterize the book is due to the fact that many
pedagogic virtues are characteristic of its author. Those who have seen
Miss Haliburton teach know that her power to inspire, interest, and
develop her pupils is not only due to the fleeting influence of the much
talked of “teacher’s personality,” but is largely a transferable ability,
due to a gifted woman’s sympathetic insight into the processes of the
child mind, illuminated by the scholar’s knowledge of genetic psychology.

An intimate acquaintance with the results attained by those whom the
author has instructed in her methods, enhances the approval which her
book itself commands.

    I saw a nest there one day.
    There were some little eggs in it.

    Was it a chickadee’s nest, Alice?
    No, it was not a chickadee’s nest.
    I saw the bird fly to the nest.

    Here is the orchard, Max.
    Let us get some flowers.
    The apple trees have pretty flowers.
    The apple flowers are red and white.

    Oh, how pretty the apple trees are!
    Look at the bees on the flowers.
    Do you know what the bees say?

    One day he was in the orchard.
    He saw an apple on the ground.
    But there was a bee on the apple.
    So the greedy pig ran after the bee.
    Then the bee flew at Piggie Wee.
    The bee made Piggie Wee run.
    It flew after him and said, “Zee, zee!”

TO THE TEACHER


The teacher who realizes the value of motor activity will be glad to find
early in this book such words and phrases as _run_, _march_, _jump_,
_sing_, _whistle_, _bounce the ball_, _toss the ball_, etc. She will know
how to utilize these in “action sentences” developed in the blackboard
lessons that usually precede reading from the book.

The vocabulary consists of 274 words, listed on pages 123 to 126, with
the number of the page on which each first occurs. They are printed in
clear type that they may be used at will for word drills.

Children vary much in their power to learn and apply phonic facts.
With some, slowness to perceive these facts is due to lack of ear
discrimination. With some, lack of power to apply the facts is due to
lack of reasoning power. The child who writes, “I like the fresh _ear_,”
and justifies her spelling by the analogies _bear_, _tear_, _wear_,
hence, _ear_, has too much reasoning power for the language she inherits.

It is expected that most teachers will teach this book by the “story”
method, supplemented by the “word and sentence” method, with recourse,
where needful, to the “phonic” method. The various combinations of any or
all of these methods, and the various devices employed will depend upon
the training, the experience, and the pedagogic faith of each teacher.
The book can be thus taught throughout without the use of phonics.

It is expected that the wise teacher will watch her class, and present
to the whole class, to the class by groups, or to individual children,
the phonic facts, when she thinks they can be best assimilated. The
teacher who presents them to all her children just as and when they occur
in the book, will do much less harm than in handling any of the purely
phonic readers, since the phonics are so easily graded, so successfully
divorced from any injurious modification of the sense of the text, and
so skillfully associated with melody and rhythm that they will never, as
presented, produce the baleful effect of correlating the sight and sound
and motor centers, with the intellect left out, under the name of reading.

The sounds of the single consonants, of the digraphs, _ch_, _sh_, _th_,
_wh_, _wr_, and _kn_, that are treated as single letters, and the short
sounds of the vowels are learned first as the initial letters of certain
words that are well known as wholes. For instance, _run_ has already
become thoroughly known as a word when the child finds it at the bottom
of page 3 printed thus:

                            Run R      run r

It will be seen from this that the word _run_ is not to be analyzed
at this stage into the two parts _r_ and _un_. Only the sound of the
letter _r_ is to be taught. This is done by having the sound of _r_
associated with the letter. The printed symbol (given here in its two
forms, the capital and the small letter) is to be known to the child as
representative of the _sound_ of the letter, not of the _name_ of the
letter. It requires but little effort to teach the child how to sound
an initial letter. The teacher may request him to “start to say” some
familiar word, as _run_, but to utter only the first sound of the word.
To facilitate the process, she may do this herself and afterward have
the child do it. When he has learned to give the sound of _r_, she shows
him the letter, which from this time is known by its sound. In this way
the sound of each letter may be taught. The names of the letters will be
learned later in the year.

The next step toward making the child self-helpful is developed in the
primer by means of phonic jingles such as will be found on page 51. The
rime is to be read aloud by the teacher and repeated or sung by the
children. Many teachers will prefer to write the rime on the blackboard.
The simple, artistic melody given with each rime helps the child to
memorize it. The appropriate story which precedes the rime and upon
which it is based, together with the picture that illustrates it, invests
the rime with interest for the children.

As will be seen, these phonic jingles contain words that are alike in
symbol as well as in sound. It is confusing to the child at this early
stage of the work to have before his eyes different symbols for the same
sound, as is the case, for instance, when he has _high_ and _sky_ to rime
with _I_, or _see_ and _me_ to rime with _sea_. His riming words at this
time should aid the eye as well as the ear. For this reason the phonic
jingles have been given.

The words of the jingle that are arranged in a column at the right of the
page, are easily separated into two parts, showing that they all belong
to the same “phonic family,” thus, _c-at_, _m-at_, etc. Such separation
of words into parts is not shown in the primer for the reason that it is
not considered best to present to the child’s eye, at this early period,
printed words that are disfigured in any way. His first book should show
the words as wholes. This fact, however, need not prevent the teacher
from using the phonic jingles for word analysis. The words in the column
having been shown as wholes to the child, he sees that they not only
rime to his ear but resemble each other to the eye. Moreover, the words
in the column look exactly like the same words when he finds them in the
sentences he reads. Before he reaches the phonic jingle on any given
page, the child has learned to know by sight and sound the consonants
that are the initial letters of the words he is to sound in the jingle.
For instance, he has learned to know and to sound the consonants _c_,
_m_, _b_, _th_, _r_, _p_, _f_, and _s_ before the phonic jingle on page
51 is given to him. It is then an easy matter to lead up to a simple
analysis of the words. The rime has been read by the teacher and repeated
or sung by the child; the words in the body of the rime, which are
repeated in the column at the right of the page, have been seen by the
child in both places. He may now be taught to cover the unlike parts (the
initial consonants) of the words in the column and show the like parts
(the phonogram that indicates the “family” to which each of the words
belongs). He may then cover the like parts, showing, in turn, the unlike
parts.

    UNLIKE PARTS    LIKE PARTS

         c-             at
         m-             at
         b-             at
        th-             at

More ambitious teachers, and those who emphasize phonics earlier in
the reading process, may wish to continue this analysis of words even
further, by separating each word into three or more parts, having the
child give the sound of each letter, thus,

    c a t,     m a t,     b a t
    m a t
    b a t

The jingles lend themselves to both treatments. But it will be more in
keeping with modern pedagogy if the separation of words is limited at
this stage to analyzing words into phonetic families, as, for instance,
the family of “at,” the family of “ap,” etc. This treatment is advised
for primer work.

Mother Goose rimes may be read later in the book where several of them
are given. Before they are read by the children the rimes should be
memorized and then dramatized in the simple childlike way in which the
young actors in the book are represented as playing Jack and Jill. A
short phonic drill is then deduced from the Mother Goose rime in much the
same way as from the phonic jingles.

When the children have learned to sound _cat_, _mat_, _hit_, _sit_,
etc. (pages 51 and 68), and to find, from these words, the stems _at_
and _it_, the teacher should reverse the process, leading the children
to build words from such stems as _an_, _am_, _and_, _end_, _in_, _on_,
_up_, _all_, _is_, _as_, etc.

    an
    can
    man
    pan
    tan
    Dan
    am
    dam
    ram
    and
    hand

    end
    bend
    mend

    in

    Don
    pond

    all
    ball
    call
    fall

    wall
    tall
    stall
    small

Next the children should be required to build lists of words that are
similar in sound and spelling to other words that are known at sight.

    lad
    glad
    had
    sad
    bad

    did
    hid

    gum
    chum

    pitch
    ditch
    hitch
    witch

    catch
    match
    hatch
    scratch

During the first school year the effect of the final _e_ on the preceding
vowel should be taught by means of words already well known to the
children, thus:

    cat
    fat
    fate
    mat
    mate
    hat
    hate

    lad
    glad
    glade
    fad

All this work may be given from the blackboard.

Some teachers will probably prefer to have the child read through the
primer before attempting to apply the knowledge of letter sounds and
phonic analysis that he has gained. Such teachers will rightly consider
it as more important than anything else that the child be led to regard
the book as a storehouse of attractive stories, and each sentence as
expressing a thought which he can get and express again. But when this
object is attained the teacher will be wise to let the child find out
how he may help himself to the thought getting by the power the initial
letter gives him of “feeling for” the new word, and later by the power
the jingles give him of “making sure” of the words.

The author has found that a vocabulary limited in quantity is a
sufficient impediment to writing interesting stories for young children.
She has, therefore, eschewed in the text any such sacrifice of sense to
sound as would limit her vocabulary in quality also. She has, however,
realized the value, in giving independence, of introducing simple phonics
early. She has, therefore, taken advantage of the natural tendency of
children to make and to repeat alliterations and rimes. In the interest
of veracity, all attempts to beguile the child into believing that
“Wag the rag in the bag” is either an interesting or an instructive
“story” are avoided; it is frankly acknowledged _to the child_ that the
alliterations and rimes in this book are “nonsense-jingles” from the side
of reason, though capable of affording enjoyment on the side of musical
appreciation.
